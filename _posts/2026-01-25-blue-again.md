The 1930 Broadway show *The Vanderbilt Revue* was a low point in the careers of producers [Lew Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Fields) and Lyle D. Andrews. It lasted only thirteen performances at New York's Vanderbilt Theatre. Perhaps one of the few memorable things about the show is [the amusingly scathing *Billboard* review written by Rives Matthews](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Billboard/RTizHfo7VH8C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22vanderbilt+revue%22+1930&pg=RA2-PA32&printsec=frontcover), who describes the revue as "a badly mounted, poorly tuned collection of efforts ranking in most instances far below third-rate vaudeville." Matthews tries to do justice to the superior efforts of a few artists who

> \[stood\] out against a somber background composed of a badly trained, gaudy costumed chorus almost totally devoid of shape or beauty, cheap, visually offensive sets, botched light cues, music which rarely recommends itself, long-drawn-out, funereal wit and some stupid dances.

The reviewer does, however, interrupt his tirade for a moment to observe that

> Miss \[Evelyn\] Hoey sings pleasantly, looks pleasant and pleases whenever she strikes a happy mean between torch and blues song. This she manages to do only once with a song called "Blue Again."

"Blue Again" is, to my knowledge, the only element of *The Vanderbilt Revue* that has had an afterlife outside its original context, and it has done surprisingly well, having been recorded roughly twenty-five times in the year after its introduction on stage, with new, notable versions released virtually every decade thereafter. We should not be surprised that this now established standard was composed by the songwriting team Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, whose output has generally overperformed.

"Blue Again" is one of those songs whose melody and even tempo tend to be at odds with its title: every version I have heard of it is comparatively upbeat, not at all blue or melancholy. Indeed, the singer does not describe themself as being more than intermittently sad---the theme is rather a long series of lover's spats, passionate love expressing itself as emotional conflict.

The Sid Phillips version of the song begins with a blaring instrumental segment that derives from [the song's lyrical intro](https://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/b/blueagain_vanderbiltrevue.html) and that evokes the idea of quarrelling. Eventually Betty Bolton begins the vocal chorus, emphasizing phrases like "even though *I hate you*" and "we'll *fight*," all the while leaving open the likelihood that she is ready to make up...again and again and again. Bolton is perfect for this song, insofar as she is able to deliver the lyrics dramatically while keeping the mood light. Ultimately, this rendition of "Blue Again" is eminently successful, with a great deal of energy and some enjoyable tension between the lovers' short-lived hate and (one hopes) longer-lived love.
