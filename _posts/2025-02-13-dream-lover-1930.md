English lyricist [Clifford Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Grey) and American composer [Victor Schertzinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Schertzinger) composed all the songs in [*The Love Parade*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Parade) (1929), legendary director [Ernst Lubitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch)'s first sound film, in which [Jeanette MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanette_MacDonald) had her cinematic debut. In it, MacDonald plays the alluring queen Louise of the fictional European country Sylvania. A soprano whose operatic voice always seemed to be gesturing toward the conventions of high culture, MacDonald was the perfect vehicle for the recurrent waltz theme "Dream Lover," a song about a persistent fantasy of perfect romantic contentment.

It is worth comparing MacDonald's vocals, either in the film itself or on [the Victor disc she made of "Dream Lover" in 1929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuar0w_YEWs), with the version of the song that Betty Bolton recorded several months later in London. To start with, Bolton was a contralto, not a soprano; she occupied the lower end of the normal range of female voices, and so, when she sings "Dream Lover," a downward transposition is necessary. When the song is delivered in a lower voice, with minimal vibrato, its operatic qualities disappear, and we are left with something refreshingly down to earth. There is, moreover, something very slow and deliberate in the way Bolton describes her dream revelations. It is as if she has reanalyzed the song so as to stress the universal romantic import of [its lyrics](https://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/d/dreamlovervarious1.html). Whereas the MacDonald version is used in *The Love Parade* to set the mood for the comings and goings of the warbly queen, in Bolton's version, the dream lover of the song is more relatable.
